# first-landing-page
It's my first landing page

Here I used CSS animation, transition, transform, filters, etc. to build different effects.
Also I used animate.css https://animate.style/
No JS but builded-in Google Maps.

The live version of web-site: https://victor-nikliaiev.github.io/first-landing-page/.
